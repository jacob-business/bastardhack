RPG-internet

music (looking for bands that sound like boris/lightning bolt)
watching TV


what i'd rather be doing:
reading (but it is hard to pay attention)
making art (but it is kind of exhausting)
watching movies (but it is hard to find a thing to watch and also hard to pay attention)

dear diary
i think alicia might have a crush on me
i find her like terror-inducingly pretty and she smiles so much
she put on chastity belt that one time at pizza night
i feel like we don't have anything in common tho and i feel like idk if we have any not-shallow connections
i feel self-conscious around her.
she really does make me feel like dying she is so pretty.
i like her haircut
she's good at spanish
i feel like i would never be able to be vulnerable around her though because i kinda just want to curl up in a ball and have someone hold my back and that really isn't the vibe.
